部分英文翻译：


王清芬和王清芳是亲姐俩，王清芬把钱借给王清芳涨利息，王清芳把钱借给林国付涨利息。（强调：这里有王清芬460万-520左右，有王清芳300万左右，可能会由于对数额和利息的认定不同和计算方式的不同而不同）

到了该林国付还钱的时候，王清芬跳过王清芳，直接和林国付达成协议，只还一部分钱就可以，其他的可以还成房子。

王清芬和林国付达成协议之后，又告知王清芳结果，王清芬还劝王清芳也接受这个协议，说这比要不着强。

王清芬，王清芳，林国付都同意了。并且在法院主持下签订了协议。林国付是被告，王清芬和王清芳是共同的原告。协议判林国付偿还王清芬和王清芳两个人一共820万资产，其中400万现金，420万房产。

（但是法院没有给两人分清一人是500万左右，一人是300万左右）

400万现金是分批到账，到账258万之后（其中237万被王清芬取走），王清芬趁着王清芳出于对其亲姐姐的信任没有要回王清芬的借据之际，直接反悔，不想要房子，只想要现金。

于是找理由跟王清芳吵架，说这里只有王清芳10万块钱（实际上有王清芳300余万），让王清芳把钱和房子都给她。王清芳不同意。

王清芬直接去法院起诉王清芳，说她把钱都借给王清芳了，没借给林国付，只问王清芳要钱。

王清芬的钱在起诉林国付时，已经做了原告，要成了一堆房子。

我方律师认为，此案已经构成债务转移，王清芬向林国付主张债务并签订调解书时，王清芳的债务就已经转移到林国付身上。

本来法院不应该再继续支持王清芬的诉求，但法院不仅支持了王清芬的诉求，而且是超额支持。

王清芬和王清芳两人在起诉林国付之后曾经多次对账，每次都是账务369万无误。但是王清芬起诉的却是428万。

原因是王清芬私藏了王清芳当初让她撕毁，她却没撕毁的3张借据，220万。并在本次起诉中使用。

法院嘴上说认定两人债务是369万，不是428万，却支持了428万其中的一部分诉讼请求。

而且判王清芬可以不承担房产，只要现金就可以。

王清芬的行为，放在绝大多数对人类正义有基本理解的国家，都应该是诈骗和虚假诉讼。但是在中国，王清芬这种行径没人管。人类世界的多元化，是指正义的多元化，而不是多种不同样式的邪恶。

而且无论是二审，再审，都是一样的结果。

再审本来有机会彻底拨乱反正。但是却维持原判。

王清芳的律师问再审法官，为什么是这样一个不公平的结果。律师说，法官只说了四个字“义愤填膺”，就不再多说。

而且再审之后，直接抓王清芳进监狱，不拿钱出来就不放人。故事大概就是这样一个故事。

故事中的王清芳，就是我的母亲。这是发生在中国，发生在我身上的故事。

============================================================
Wang Qingfen and Wang Qingfang are two sisters. 

Wang Qingfen lends the money to Wang Qingfang to increase interest, 

and Wang Qingfang lends the money to Lin Guofu to increase interest.（there are about 5million belongs to Wang Qingfen ,3 million yuan belongs to Wang Qingfang)


When it's time to ask Lin Guofu pay back, Wang Qingfen jumps over Wang Qingfang and directly reaches an agreement with Lin Guofu. 

Only part of the money can be returned, and others can be changed into houses. 

After Wang Qingfen and Lin Guofu reached an agreement, they informed Wang Qingfang of the result. 

Wang Qingfen urged Wang Qingfang to accept the agreement, saying that "it is better than pay back nothing".

Wang Qingfen, Wang Qingfang and Lin Guofu all agreed. And signed an agreement under the auspices of the court. 

Lin Guofu is the defendant, Wang Qingfen and Wang Qingfang are the common plaintiff. 

It is agreed that Lin Guofu will give 8.2 million assets to Wang Qingfen and Wang Qingfang, including 4 million cash and 4.2 million houses.

(but Chinese court didn't cauculate how much money for each common plaintiff)

The 4 million cash was received in batches. 

After the 2.58 million cash was received (2.37 million of which was taken away by Wang Qingfen), 

Wang Qingfen, taking advantage of Wang Qingfang's trust in her sister, didn't want to return to Wang Qingfen's receipt, directly repented, 

Wang Qingfen didn't want any houses, just wanted cash.

So She found a reason to quarrel with Wang Qingfang, saying that there is only 0.1million  yuan for Wang Qingfang, (infact 3 million)

and asked Wang Qingfang to give her the money and the house. Wang Qingfang disagrees.

Wang Qingfen went directly to the court to sue Wang Qingfang, saying that she lent all the money to Wang Qingfang, but didn't lend it to Lin Guofu, so she asked Wang Qingfang for money.

When Wang Qingfen's money sued Lin Guofu, She is a plaintiff.

And the money had become a pile of houses all by herself. 

Our lawyer believes that this case has constituted a debt transfer. 

When Wang Qingfen claims debt to Lin Guofu and signs a mediation agreement, Wang Qingfang's debt has been transferred to Lin Guofu.

The court should not continue to support Wang Qingfen's appeal, but the court not only supported Wang Qingfen's appeal, but also over supported it.

After suing Lin Guofu, Wang Qingfen and Wang Qingfang checked accounts for many times, it is 3.69 million everytime. 

But Wang Qingfen sued 4.28 million. 

The reason is that Wang Qingfen secretly hid the three receipt that Wang Qingfang had let her tear up, but she didn't tear up, 2.2 million. And used in this prosecution.

The court said that the debt of the theirs was 3.69 million, not 4.28 million, but supported part of 4.28 million. 

And Chinese court judges Wang Qingfen does not need to bear any house, just cash.

Wang Qingfen's behavior, in the mose of countries with a basic understanding of human justice in the world , should be fraud and false litigation. 

But in China, no one cares about Wang Qingfen's behavior. 

The pluralism of the human world refers to the pluralism of justice, not a variety of different forms of evil.

And whether it's the second trial or the retrial, it's the same result.

There was a chance for retrial to set things right.

But the original judgment was upheld. 

Wang Qingfang's lawyer asked the retrial judge why it was such an unfair result.  

Lawyer said that the judge said only these words "Very Very Angry", and he no longer say more.

Moreover, after the retrial, Wang Qingfang was directly arrested and put into prison. If she did not take money out, CPP would not let Wang Qingfang go. The story is probably such a story.

Wang Qingfang in the story is my mother. This is a true story that happened to my family in China.
